Does school really expect you to remember when and where every class is, AND what’s due at what time?
Staying organized is harder now than ever, so even if you were a super computer you’d still struggle.
Don’t worry, we’ve got an app that will help even the laziest students stay organized, productive, and, dare we say, ON TIME!


This app includes lots of funtionalities like a `Note Taking App`, this organizational app is great for students, for staying organized and on top of your homework or exams, but what about taking the notes themselves? This is the best app for recording notes, lectures, videos, or whatever else you need to do. This is just one of our amazing apps, so what do you think, you will install it?

If you wish to become a project developer (permission to create branches on the
project without forking for easier collaboration), have at least one PR
approved and ask for it. If you contribute regularly to the project the role
may be offered to you without asking too.
